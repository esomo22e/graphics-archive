    <h1>Can A Computer Do Your Job?</h1>
    <h2><p>Computers are increasingly capable of replacing humans for routine tasks. Research from Oxford attempts to quantify the likelihood that any particular job will be computerized within the next TKTK years. It does this by scoring the jobs on several different indexes, which are combined to estimate a probability.</p>
<p>Find your job below to see what their research says about your future.</p></h2>
