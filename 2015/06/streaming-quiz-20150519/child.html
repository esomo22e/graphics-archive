Adding specialized equipment to your system can boost the audio quality, but if there are weak links in the chain (say, if you\u2019ve got a digital-to-analog converter and cheap earbuds), you won\u2019t hear as much. Bonus hint: Scroll back up and listen to the uncompressed WAV files again \u2013 even self-proclaimed audiophiles say that it takes time for your ears to adjust to the differences in files.</p>", "c": "<p>If you did well on this and were listening through built-in speakers, you either have extraordinary ears or got lucky. If you had trouble picking out different versions of these songs, we give you permission to blame your tools. The speakers on your phone, laptop or tablet weren&rsquo;t made for anything resembling hi-definition audio. Plug in a pair of headphones and try again.</p>", "d": "<p>Is your device a phone? If so, its headphone jack was probably designed for, well, headphones. Plugging it directly into speakers will boost your volume,which can, in some cases, be enough to make low-quality MP3s sound really bad. But without an amp or digital-to-analog converter, you probably won\u2019t be able to hear the differences between the 320 kbps MP3 and the uncompressed WAV file.</p>", "e": "<p>To hear subtle differences in files of varying sound quality, it helps to turn up the volume. If you&rsquo;ve ever blasted low-quality MP3s, even through an excellent system, you&rsquo;ve probably heard how distorted a 128 kbps MP3 can sound. If you&rsquo;re stepping up to lossless digital audio, a combination of decent speakers and an amp or digital audio converter is likely to add up to your highest sonic return on investment, before you go all-in with hi-def audio files.</p>", "f": "<p>Bluetooth speakers are wonderfully portable, and the sound of transmission itself has improved over the last few years. But there are two major issues: Your music is being compressed again in order to transmit it from your device to your speakers or headphones and most bluetooth speakers include a single speaker or are small enough that they basically eliminate stereophonic sound. Even in the age of the cloud, wires still sound better.</p>"};
