    <h1>What A 2 Percent Fee&nbsp;Means</h1>
    <h2><strong>Let's say you invest $10,000, and that investment makes a 7 percent return every year.</strong> After 40 years, that investment would be worth $149,745. But if you've invested in a fund that charges a 2 percent annual fee, you've cut your return to 5 percent. And over 40 years, your investment would instead be worth only $70,400 &mdash; <strong>a difference of $79,345</strong>.</h2>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>The math gets a lot more complicated when you consider additional factors, such as market fluctuations, inflation and additional contributions over time. But the point remains: Fees take a significant chunk out of your potential long-term return.</p>
