            <li class="r1">Now, it's on to South Carolina on Jan. 21 and Florida on Jan. 31. Join us for our live coverage of those primaries as the race for the Republican presidential nomination continues.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 11:13 PM</span>

        <li class="r2">Put New Hampshire in the books. The headlines: "Romney Solidifies Lead," "Paul Makes Strong Showing," "Huntsman Snags Third," "Gingrich And Santorum Trail."         <span class="date">January 10 2012, 11:11 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r3">It's all over except for who comes in fourth. And it may be a while before we know that. With 81 percent of precincts reporting, just 65 votes separate former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Will Gingrich keep that edge?        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 11:04 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r4">Four years ago, pollsters were way off: They thought Barack Obama would win, but it was Hillary Rodham Clinton who came in first in the Democratic primary. This time, they were much closer to reality:         (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_republican_presidential_primary-1581.html">link</a>) <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:58 PM</span>

        <li class="r5">Goodbye New Hampshire, hello South Carolina: Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum all have events Wednesday in the Palmetto State. As we've said, it hosts the next big primary, on Jan. 21.          (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestate.com/primary/">link</a>) <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:50 PM</span>

        <li class="r6">Another key to Mitt Romney's victory: A strong ground game. Pew Research Center's Michael Dimock says a majority of GOP primary voters surveyed today said they had been contacted by the Romney campaign. Other candidates didn't do as good a job on getting their supporters out to vote.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:42 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r7">Turnout update: With about three-quarter of precincts reporting, nearly 172,000 votes have been tallied in the Republican primary. Four years ago, there were 250,000 ballots cast in the GOP primary.         (<a target="_blank" href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/01/new-hampshire-primary-turnout-william-gardner-/1">link</a>) <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:38 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r8">Is there a John Kerry future for Mitt Romney? NPR's Mara Liasson just said on the air that if Romney is the GOP nominee, Democrats will go after what Romney thinks is his strength -- his business experience -- just as Republican operatives attacked Sen. John Kerry's war record in the 2004 campaign.         <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:34 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r9">Exit interviews signal Mitt Romney was competitive or ahead among various types of voters today, Pew Research Center's Michael Dimock tells us. He got 23 percent of the votes from those who see themselves as independents, for example, and 30 percent of the votes from "strong conservatives."        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:30 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r10">"Late deciders" who made up their minds in the last few days accounted for 47 percent of today's voters, says Pew Research Center's Michael Dimock. About one-third chose Mitt Romney.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:16 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r11">More data from exit interviews: "A 63 percent majority of Romney's backers today say they made up their minds earlier than in the past three days, as did 60 percent of Ron Paul's supporters," says Pew Research Center's Michael Dimock.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:14 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r12">Two-thirds of precincts are now in. Mitt Romney: 38 percent. Ron Paul: 23 percent. Jon Huntsman: 17 percent. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum: Just under 10 percent each.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:11 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r13">So, now that we've heard from Jon Huntsman, Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum, it appears that all of the remaining GOP contenders plan to go on to campaign in South Carolina (for its Jan. 21 primary). It was certain when the night began, of course, that Mitt Romney and Ron Paul would be doing that as well.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:08 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r14">Newt Gingrich just asked his supporters to "make a list of every person you know in South Carolina [where there's a primary on Jan. 21] and every person you know in Florida [primary on Jan. 31]" to enlist their support in his campaign. Gingrich added that he is "capable of debating Barack Obama face-to-face."        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:05 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r15">Newt Gingrich: "I believe if we had a Republican House, Republican Senate, and a Gingrich presidency, we'd get amazing things done."        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:02 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r16">Newt Gingrich is also now addressing supporters. He too vows to take the campaign on to South Carolina and its Jan. 21 primary.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:01 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r17">"We are going to go on to South Carolina" and its Jan. 21 primary, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum just said. The race isn't settled, he added, by just two or three contests.         <span class="date">January 10 2012, 10:00 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r18">It's Santorum, not Gingrich, who has taken to a microphone. "First and foremost," he just told supporters, "we need ... to defeat Barack Obama." And he thinks his campaign can do that.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:58 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r19">Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in a statement from his campaign: "Tonight's results in New Hampshire show the race for 'conservative alternative' to Mitt Romney remains wide open." He basically skipped this primary to focus on South Carolina's Jan. 21 contest. Perry has gotten about 0.7 percent of the votes in New Hampshire.         (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nhpr.org/new-hampshire-primary-2012">link</a>) <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:54 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r20">Who will speak next? Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum? Cable news channels are saying it will be Gingrich.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:49 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r21">Rick Santorum keeps things close again: With 55 percent of precincts reporting, he's 30 votes ahead of Newt Gingrich in the race for fourth. Last week in Iowa, Santorum came in eight votes behind Mitt Romney (according to still-not-quite-official results).        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:45 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r22">Update: About half the precincts have reported and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has about 38 percent of the votes to Rep. Ron Paul's 23 percent and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman's 17 percent. Running neck-and-neck for fourth: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, each with just under 10 percent.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:38 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r23">Saying "we have done what this nation can do," Jon Huntsman just said to cheering supporters that "it is time to bring the troops home from Afghanistan."        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:36 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r24">If the nation doesn't tackle its problems, Jon Huntsman just said, "we will see the end of the American Century by 2050. We are not going to let that happen."        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:34 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r25">"Third place is a ticket to ride, ladies and gentlemen," former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman just told his supporters. "Hello, South Carolina!"        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:30 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r26">Funniest candidate? Former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, who's getting about 0.4 percent of the votes, tweeted earlier that "I am happy [to] report that I'm ahead of Herman Cain, 'Total Write-Ins,' and a guy wearing a boot on his head." (Actually, he's now trailing "total write-ins.")

    </li>
        <li class="r27">"Maybe the best news for Romney out of NH is that it isn't any more obvious--maybe less--which conservative should become the anti-Romney," writes oft-quoted political scientist Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia.         (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/#!/LarrySabato/status/156917888312295425">link</a>) <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:21 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r28">"The economy was the overwhelming concern for New Hampshire voters today -- 61 percent said it was the single most important issue shaping their vote, and 68 percent said they are very worried about the direction of the U.S. economy," the Pew Research Center's Michael Dimock reports. "Mitt Romney won, overwhelmingly, among these voters."

        <li class="r30">"We've had enough of sending our kids and our money around the world to be the policemen of the world," Rep. Ron Paul just declared. "It's time to bring them home." To which his supporters chanted: "Bring them home! Bring them home!"        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:08 PM</span>
    </li>
        <li class="r31">Monetary policy and the Federal Reserve "will remain a dominant issue" in the campaign because of his candidacy and the support he's getting, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) said to cheering supporters.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 09:06 PM</span>

        <li class="r33">Mitt Romney "certainly had a clear cut victory, but we're nibbling at his heels," Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) just told his supporters.

    </li>
        <li class="r40">Also on other Republicans' attacks on his business record, Mitt Romney said: "President Obama wants to put free enterprise on trial. In the last few days, we have seen some desperate Republicans join forces with him. This is such a mistake for our party and for our nation.  This country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy."        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 08:41 PM</span>

        <li class="r41">For the record: President Obama did indeed win the Democratic primary (in which he had no  significant challengers). With 25 percent of precincts reporting, he has about 81 percent of the votes.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 08:39 PM</span>

        <li class="r42">"If you want to make this election about restoring American greatness than I hope you'll join us," Mitt Romney just told supporters.

        <li class="r45">Mitt Romney just asked "the citizens of South Carolina," who hold their primary on Jan. 21, to "join the citizens of New Hampshire and make 2012 the year he [President Obama] runs out of time."        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 08:31 PM</span>

Mitt Romney is the winner of the 2012 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary. No firm word yet on the order of finish for the rest of the field.

    </li>
        <li class="r58">Brace for a "call": All polls will be closed by 8 p.m. ET. News outlets will move as fast as possible to declare a winner if the combination of exit polls and real vote counts give them enough information to go on.         <span class="date">January 10 2012, 07:51 PM</span>

        <li class="r70">Earlier today, former GOP candidate Herman Cain criticized the remaining candidates for attacking each other, saying they had broken former President Reagan's "13th commandment" -- never criticize another Republican. Reagan, you might recall, referred to that as the "11th commandment."

        <li class="r72">Many New Hampshire polls close at 7 p.m. ET (others are open as late as 8 p.m.).

        <li class="r74">About two-thirds of the Republican voters in today's primary said "they are satisfied with the Republican candidates they had to choose from," Pew Research's Michael Dimock says. That's based on what voters said in early "exit polls" done for the National Election Pool.        <span class="date">January 10 2012, 06:42 PM</span>

        <li class="r75">Candidates spent less in New Hampshire this time around than in earlier campaign cycles, according to New Hampshire Public Radio and NPR's StateImpact project. A major reason: They got lots of free exposure from debates ... "over, and over, and over again."

        <li class="r76">Polls indicate "most of the action in the primary may be for second and third place," NPR's Don Gonyea reports from New Hampshire, as Rep.

    </li>
        <li class="r77">More from the early exit polls: about 7 in 10 GOP voters "said they were very worried about the direction of the nation's economy, far more than said so four years ago," The Associated Press reports.

        <li class="r78">Last week in Iowa, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney collected about the same share of votes (25 percent) as he did there in 2008.

        <li class="r80">A bit of history: New Hampshire has been holding the nation's first presidential primary since the 1952 campaign. But as the <em>New Hampshire Union Leader</em> explains, the primary system "traces its roots to the reform efforts that swept the nation in the early part" of the last century.

        <li class="r84">Before we forget, and because it's never too early to look ahead to the next contest: The always important South Carolina primary is set for Jan. 21. Yes, that's a Saturday.

        <li class="r85">Heading into today's voting, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney remained atop the polls of voters. The website Real Clear Politics, which tracks such surveys, shows him with about a 20 percentage point advantage over Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). Close behind Paul: Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. Further back: former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich.         (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_republican_presidential_primary-1581.html#polls">link</a>) <span class="date">January 10 2012, 05:22 PM</span>
