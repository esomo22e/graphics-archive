        	<p>An <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=155978300">investigation</a> by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity found federal regulators and the mining industry are failing to protect miners from the excessive toxic coal mine dust that causes black lung. The disease is now being diagnosed in younger miners and evolving more quickly to complicated stages.</p>

        			<p>Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, or black lung, is a disease caused by inhaling coal mine dust. The advanced form, referred to as complicated, is also known as progressive massive fibrosis. The accumulation of the dust particles in the lungs causes breathing complications. Those diagnosed with the simple form of the disease may not notice any symptoms, but as the disease progresses, a cough and shortness of breath develops, as well as moderate to severe airway obstruction, decreasing quality of life. The disease is diagnosed through chest X-rays and breathing tests.</p>

        				<h4>Government And Industry Failures</h4>
        				<p>Strict limits on coal dust exposure were set in 1969, but loopholes permit companies to expose miners to excessive dust. Compliance depends on the industry's self-policing, but enforcement is mixed and many miners report routine manipulation of sampling that fools federal inspectors.

        				<h4>Increased Hours And Production Pressure</h4>
        				<p>Greater demand and higher coal prices forced miners to work harder and longer. The average workweek grew 11 hours in the last 30 years. In 2010, production was triple what it was when new coal dust limits were put in place.</p>
