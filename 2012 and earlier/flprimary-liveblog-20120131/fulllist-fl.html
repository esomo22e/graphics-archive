                <li class="r0">So here's where things stand after four contests. A virtual tie between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in Iowa. An easy win in New Hampshire for Romney. A decisive victory in South Carolina for Newt Gingrich. And today, a big win for Romney in Florida. Next up: Nevada's GOP caucuses on Saturday.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 10:06 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r1">To come back and challenge Mitt Romney for the top spot again, Newt Gingrich has "got to broaden [his support] beyond the very conservative core," the Pew Research Center's Michael Dimock just told NPR on the air.         <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:55 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r2">Back in front? That's the conclusion in stories from NPR.org (Mitt Romney is "the clear front-runner), <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> (which says he is again "the favorite to win his party's nomination") and <em>The New York Times</em> (Romney's in a "dominant position").        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:47 PM</span>

            <li class="r4">"We want our freedoms back, we don't want more government!" Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, says as he wraps up his speech in Henderson, Nev., where he's campaigning in advance of Saturday's Nevada caucuses.         <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:41 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r5">In Henderson, Nev., Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, continues to give his enthusiastic supporters what they came to hear: his focus on personal liberty and the Constitution.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:37 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r6">Rick Santorum's basic message tonight has been that "Republicans can do better" and that the mudslinging between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich is only hurting the party, NPR's Liz Halloran reports from Las Vegas.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:34 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r7">Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, begins his address to supporters in Nevada with a traditional note: "I called Gov. Romney and congratulated him." He also told Romney, Paul says, that he will "see him soon in the caucus states" such as Nevada.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:32 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r8">The number of precincts tabulated is approaching 95 percent. Mitt Romney's share is staying just below 47 percent. Newt Gingrich's is just below 32 percent.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:27 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r9">As he wraps up, Newt Gingrich tells supporters: "I pledge to you my life, my fortune and my sacred honor. This is about America."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:23 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r10">Charging that President Obama has "declared war on the Catholic Church and other religious institutions," Newt Gingrich says as president he would repeal "every anti-religious act of the Obama administration."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:22 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r11">"I'm not going to compete with Obama on singing because I'm not running for entertainer in chief," says Newt Gingrich -- in a shot at the president recent channeling of a little Al Green.         <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:20 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r12">If he's elected, Newt Gingrich says, his first executive order "will abolish all of the White House czars as of that moment."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:18 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r13">Pointing back to the "Contract with America" that he and other Republicans crafted in 1994, Newt Gingrich says in coming days he'll be rolling out a new contract that's "personal between me and you."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:17 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r14">"If you're comfortable with the way America is decaying, then we don't have to change much," says Newt Gingrich. All that needs to be done is to "manage the decay." He says he's running "to make sure we change direction."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:15 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r15">The future he offers, Newt Gingrich says, is one of "jobs ... lower gasoline prices ... a smaller Washington ... and more power back to you and you family."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:13 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r16">"If Barack Obama gets re-elected it will be a disaster for the United States of America," says Newt Gingrich.         <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:12 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r17">"We are going to contest every place and we are going to win and we are going to be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Newt Gingrich tells supporters (and he adds that he wants the "elite media" to get that message).        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:11 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r18">It's now "a two-person race between the conservative leader Newt Gingrich and the Massachusetts moderate," the former House speaker declares.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:10 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r19">"I want to thank Floridians. Everybody here has been so positive," Newt Gingrich says as he starts his remarks.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 09:09 PM</span>

    </li>
            <li class="r26">Newt Gingrich's second-place finish today shows that he "couldn't deliver in Florida," Rick Santorum tells CNN. He predicts that Republicans are now going to be "looking for a different conservative" --  him.         <span class="date">January 31 2012, 08:53 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r27">"We were not in the position to compete on a financial basis" in Florida, former Sen. Rick Santorum tells CNN. He's in Las Vegas. Nevada's caucuses are on Saturday.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 08:52 PM</span>

            <li class="r30">Worth noting: Usually the winner gets to speak last on nights like this. But tonight, it looks like it will be Newt Gingrich who gets the "last word."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 08:46 PM</span>

            <li class="r31">As he finishes his victory speech, Mitt Romney continues to paint a picture of a troubled nation where he says people now "dread each new headline."          <span class="date">January 31 2012, 08:43 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r32">Another line aimed at President Obama: He'll make hope something people have again, Mitt Romney says, not "a faded word on an old bumper sticker."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 08:41 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r33">After saying President Obama "wants to grow government and continue to amass trillion dollar deficits," Mitt Romney says he will cut government and without raising taxes will "finally get America to a balanced budget."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 08:38 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r34">Drawing inspiration from Thomas Paine, Mitt Romney says to President Obama "you were elected to lead, you chose to follow, now it's time for you to get out of the way."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 08:37 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r35">Mitt Romney turns his sights on President Obama, saying the results since the Democrat became president have not been good for the country. They include, he says, "35 months of unemployment above 8 percent."        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 08:35 PM</span>
    </li>
            <li class="r36">"Thank you tonight for this great victory!" Mitt Romney tells his supporters in Tampa.

            <li class="r38">In the first major contest in which only Republicans could take part, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, is getting about 7 percent of the vote.

    </li>
            <li class="r51">Reminder: All polls will be closed in Florida at 8 p.m. ET. Watch for news networks to quickly start making "calls" based on both actual vote counts and exit poll data.         <span class="date">January 31 2012, 07:44 PM</span>

            <li class="r72">Looking for the official results? The Florida Department of State's Division of Elections will start posting them here at 8 p.m ET:         (<a target="_blank" href="http://enight.dos.state.fl.us/">link</a>) <span class="date">January 31 2012, 06:04 PM</span>

            <li class="r73">Also from the early exit polls of voters: "About half ... believed it most important that the GOP candidate could beat [President] Obama in November," the AP reports.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 05:58 PM</span>

            <li class="r74">Early "exit polls" of Republicans as they left voting places today showed that nearly two-thirds put the economy atop the list of most important issues facing the nation, The Associated Press reports.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 05:54 PM</span>

            <li class="r75">In the 2008 Florida Republican primary, Sen. John McCain of Arizona won with 36 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney was second with 31 percent.

            <li class="r76">One wrinkle about this Super Tuesday: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich won't be on the ballot in one of the biggest states, Virginia. His campaign didn't get enough valid signatures on petitions to meet the state's ballot requirements.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 05:44 PM</span>

            <li class="r77">After today, the GOP campaign slows a bit. There are caucuses coming up in a few states. And on Feb. 29, Michigan and Arizona hold their primaries. The next "big date," though, is March 6 -- so-called Super Tuesday -- when Republicans vote in 10 states.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 05:42 PM</span>

            <li class="r78">Heading into today's voting, polls of Florida Republicans put former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney about 13 percentage points ahead of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was in second. Trailing them: former Sen. Rick Santorum and Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who have already moved on to campaign in other states.

            <li class="r79">At stake today: Florida's 99 delegates to the GOP National Convention (which is in Tampa this year). But it's not quite that simple. Because the state GOP scheduled its primary earlier than the Republican National Committee wished, Florida might lose half its delegates.        <span class="date">January 31 2012, 05:41 PM</span>

            <li class="r80">Good evening. Welcome to our live blogging of the news from Florida, which today holds its Republican presidential primary.
