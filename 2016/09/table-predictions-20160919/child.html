<li>Debate mishap: Most likely it will be around inappropriate laughter; some kind of cackle that could turn into an internet meme the way Gore&#8217;s sighs once did.</li>
<li>A revelation about the Clinton Foundation.  Perhaps it behaved badly somewhere that it was supposed to be helping or went to some lavish conference.</li>

<li>Connections with Russia/Putin</li>
<li>Immigration: Trump has a record of saying he will deport all immigrants who are here illegally. He will be accused of wanting to deport all those DREAMer kids. He will get caught in a contradiction over it.</li>
<li>Health: Trump&#8217;s own health or how he reacts to Hillary Clinton&#8217;s health.</li>
<li>Revelations that Donald Trump is planning for a post-election end game if he doesn&#8217;t win.  In particular,  rumors that he plans to start a Trump TV network.</li>

<li>WikiLeaks will be in the top. It&#8217;s never really left the top. But, as speculation grows of another release or one happens, this will be the No. 2 controversy around Clinton.</li>
<li>Hillary&#8217;s health &#8212; it did show off one of the trends in our model &#8212; something that had a high level of buzz &#8212; and now the idea of her health: Is she healthy enough to serve as president?</li>
<li>Benghazi because it keeps popping up with regularity.</li>
<li>New emails could emerge that will show that there was pay to play at the Clinton Foundation, which fits into the narrative that Hillary Clinton has something to hide.</li>
