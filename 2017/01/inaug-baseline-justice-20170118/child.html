                    This four-fold increase does not represent a huge increase in the number of people killed by police; rather, it reflects a change in methodology, after it became clear in 2014 that the government had been vastly undercounting those deaths. The new counting method takes into consideration media reports of deaths that aren&#8217;t always reported to the government by local police.

                    This number jumps around from year to year, but long-term trends are generally positive: In the early 1990s, officers were killed at twice the rate. Still, there is concern about the steady increase in the reported incidents of assaults on officers over the past few years.

                    The violent crime rate was much lower in 2015 than 2008, continuing a general decline in crime rates since the 1990s. However, Americans&#8217; opinions haven&#8217;t tracked with that; <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165653/crime-americans-seem-noticed.aspx">Gallup found</a> in 2013 that Americans&#8217; perceptions of crime levels have not fallen off with that crime rate.
