                    The Gini index measures inequality on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 representing total equality (that is, equal income for everyone) and 1 represents total inequality (one person with all the income). This measure inched upward between 2008 and 2015, from 0.466 to 0.479.

                    One measure of inequality is how much more the richest earn than the poorest. That gap grew over Obama&#8217;s presidency; in 2008, an earner at the 90th percentile earned 11.37 times someone at the 10th percentile. In 2015, it was 12.23 times as much.

                <td class="about">
                    Under Obama, the federal deficit grew much bigger before it got smaller. It ballooned from 3.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 9.8 percent in 2009, due to programs implemented to stabilize the economy during the recession. The stimulus greatly increased the deficit, but it also helped pull the economy out of a deep recession.

                    The federal debt grew sharply during the early years of the Obama presidency, then continued to climb at a slower rate after that. Some of that was his fault, and some of that wasn&#8217;t; he did sign expensive measures, like the stimulus and later tax cut extensions, but the debt had also already been projected to grow in a big way even before he took office, as the <a href="http://crfb.org/blogs/has-president-obama-doubled-national-debt">Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget</a> notes.

                <td class="about">
                    The labor force participation rate has declined since Obama took office. Part of that is due to demographic shifts; as baby boomers retire, that will drag the rate downward, as those people will no longer be working or looking for jobs. The same goes for many adults who are in school. However, some of this downward movement is because of a bad economy; as of 2014, the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/113th-congress-2013-2014/reports/45011-LaborMarket-OneCol.pdf">CBO</a> attributed half the decline at that time to demographics and half to economic problems.
