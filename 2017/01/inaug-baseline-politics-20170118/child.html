                    We have framed these in terms of Democrats because those were Obama&#8217;s party; Republican trends, of course, moved in the opposite direction. President Obama entered the White House leading a party with a comfortable majority in the House. But after that first Congress, Democrats were never again in the majority, and today, Republicans have almost as big a share of seats as Dems did in 2009, giving Trump a big advantage in passing his agenda.

                    President Obama started off his time as president with 58 fellow Democrats in the Senate, but still not a filibuster-proof majority. He held on to a slim majority for the next three Congresses but lost it after the 2014 election.
